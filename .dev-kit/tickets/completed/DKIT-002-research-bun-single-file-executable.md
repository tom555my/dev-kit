title: Research Bun Single-File Executable Build Process
category: Research
---

## User Story

- As a CLI developer, I need to understand how to build a Bun project as a single-file executable, so that I can create a portable, easy-to-distribute CLI tool for dev-kit initialization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Document Bun's single-file executable build process (`bun build` CLI flags and options)
- Identify best practices for structuring a Bun CLI project for single-file compilation
- Research how to handle dynamic file operations (copying skills, creating directories) within a single-file executable
- Document how to embed static assets (skill files, templates, onboarding guides) in a Bun executable
- Research cross-platform compatibility considerations (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Identify any Bun-specific APIs or patterns needed for file system operations in executables
- Document executable size optimization strategies
- Research code signing and distribution practices for Bun executables
